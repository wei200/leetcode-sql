-- Solution 1: using left join
SELECT
customer_id,
COUNT(v.visit_id) AS count_no_trans
FROM Visits v
LEFT JOIN Transactions t
ON t.visit_id = v.visit_id
WHERE T.visit_id IS NULL
GROUP BY customer_id

-- Solution 2: subquery
SELECT
customer_id,
COUNT(*) AS count_no_trans
FROM Visits
WHERE visit_id NOT IN (SELECT visit_id FROM Transactions)
GROUP BY customer_id
